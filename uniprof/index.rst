Introduction
************

The Universal Profiler is a new profiling system that replaces multiple profiling utilities (including FPS Explorer, Resource Statistics, Dog Watch, WG profiler, and BW profiler). It profiles the World of Tanks client over a variety of indicators and measurementsâ€”in particular, performance and memory usage.

When running, it writes output to a log as a .upl file. Afterwards, the analyzer processes the log, extracts the data and presents it in a convenient format.
