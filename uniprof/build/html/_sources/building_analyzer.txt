Building the Profile Analyzer
*****************************

Profile Analyzer is built by a specific solution (profile_analyzer), which is created by the cmake. Building the 64-bit Profile Analyzer is recommended.

Before you run the cmake, indicate the path to the Qt by defining the environment variable ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt\Qt5.2.0\5.2.0\msvc2012_64\`` (path can be different).
